DIABETES-PREDICTION-PROJECT
The Diabetes Prediction Project employs machine learning to predict diabetes outcomes from health metrics. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, outlier handling, and model building using SVM with hyperparameter tuning. The model's performance is evaluated through accuracy, classification reports, and feature importance analysis.
